        <h1># About the Event</h1>
        <p>
            GSoC is an annual global program, conducted by Google, with an aim to promote open-source development. This
            session is aimed to make you all aware of GSoC
            & motivate you to take part in the upcoming GSoC ‘22.
            <br> <br>
            <span># Goal of the program</span> <br>
            The GSoC program has several goals:
            <br>
            - Inspire developers to begin participating in open source development. <br>
            - Help open source projects identify and bring in new developers. <br>
            - Get more open source code written and released for the benefit of all. <br>
            - Give newer developers more exposure to real-world software development (for example, distributed
            development and version control, software licensing issues, testing, and communication best practices).
            <br><br>
            <span># Key topics to be covered:</span><br>
            - Speaker’s experience at GSoC’21
            - Benefits of open source development
            - Why should you take part in GSoC’22?
            <br><br>
            <span># A Brief History of Google Summer of Code</span> <br>

            Google Summer of Code began in 2005 as a complex experiment with a simple goal: helping students find work
            related to their academic pursuits during their school holidays. In GSoC’s first year, 40 projects and 400
            students participated. By the conclusion of the 17th Google Summer of Code in 2021, over 18,000 students
            have
            been accepted into the program. Best of all, most of the organizations participating over the past 17 years
            reported that the program helped them find new community members and active committers.
            <br>
            GSoC has grown immensely over the last 17 years and in the process helped students make the most of their
            summer
            by working on exciting open source projects.

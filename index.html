                GSoC is an annual global program, conducted by Google, with an aim to promote open-source development.
                This
                session is aimed to make you all aware of GSoC
                & motivate you to take part in the upcoming GSoC ‘22.
                <br> <br>
                <span># Goal of the program</span>
                The GSoC program has several goals:
                <br>
                • Inspire developers to begin participating in open source development. <br>
                • Help open source projects identify and bring in new developers. <br>
                • Get more open source code written and released for the benefit of all. <br>
                • Provide novice developers with the exposure to real-world software development.
                <br><br>
                <span># Key topics to be covered:</span>
                • Speaker’s experience at GSoC’21 <br>
                • Benefits of open source development <br>
                • Why should you take part in GSoC’22?
                <br><br>
                <span># A Brief History of Google Summer of Code</span>

                Google Summer of Code began in 2005 as a complex experiment with a simple goal: helping students find
                work
                related to their academic pursuits during their school holidays. In GSoC’s first year, 40 projects and
                400
                students participated. By the conclusion of the 17th Google Summer of Code in 2021, over 18,000 students
                have been accepted into the program.
                <br>
                Best of all, most of the organizations participating over the past 17 years
                reported that the program helped them find new community members and active committers.
